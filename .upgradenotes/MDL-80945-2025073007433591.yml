  mod_quiz:
    - message: >
        A new base class `access_override_rule_base` has been added to `mod_quiz`
        giving `quizaccess` subplugins the ability to be included in the override
        settings.

        `quizaccess` subplugins can implement this functionality by extending the
        base class, name it `override_rule` and implement the base functions.

        See https://moodledev.io/docs/apis/plugintypes/quizaccess for details.
